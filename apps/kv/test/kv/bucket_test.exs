# We donâ€™t need to explicitly stop the agent because it is linked to the test process and 
# the agent is shut down automatically once the test finishes. 
# This will always work unless the process is named.

# Also note that we passed the async: true option to ExUnit.Case. 
# This option makes this test case run in parallel with other test cases that set up the :async option. 
# This is extremely useful to speed up our test suite by using multiple cores in our machine.
